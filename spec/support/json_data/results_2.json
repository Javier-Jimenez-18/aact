Secondarily, to analyze the degree of satisfaction in the proposed treatment modality. This is a randomized controlled trial, double blind (evaluator and patient), parallel in three groups (synchronous telemonitoring group, asynchronous telemonitoring group and control group). The protocol will last six weeks, and quality of life, upper limb functionality, and risk of lymphedema will be evaluated. Both intervention groups will be submitted to a kinesiotherapy program three times a week, with synchronous and asynchronous monitoring, while the control group will receive usual post cancer orientations. Kinesiotherapy protocol in synchronous form compared to the usual recommendations in remote form is expected to show superior result in upper limb function and quality of life of women after breast cancer.",
              "DetailedDescription":"This is a randomized, double blind (evaluator and patient), parallel control trial in three groups (synchronous telemonitoring group, asynchronous telemonitoring group, and control group). The allocation of the participants will be done by an external member, through a masked draw, the name of each participant will be in numbered opaque envelopes, which will only be opened after the initial evaluation, to blind the evaluating therapist, a second therapist will be responsible for the application of the interventions. The protocol for the intervention groups will last 6 weeks, and the exercises will basically consist of active stretching, mobilization and scapular stabilization, and active shoulder exercises with gradual range of motion. The intervention was based on previous studies that used standard kinesiotherapy in their outcomes.\n\nThe sessions for the synchronous telemonitoring group will be supervised and conducted via video call using the WhatsApp® application, lasting 50 minutes, 3 times a week.\n\nFor the asynchronous telemonitoring group, an explanatory schedule with the exercises to be performed during the week will be delivered weekly via e-mail and WhatsApp®. The exercises will be the same as those performed by the previous group, and the participant will be free to ask any questions about the protocol with the therapist at any time via text message or e-mail. The control group will receive only the usual orientation booklet for post-breast cancer women. The participants who agree to participate in the research will sign the Informed Consent Form, and may withdraw from the research at any stage of the study. Assessment and intervention collection will take place via video call. The personal identification data of the participants will be preserved in accordance with the resolution of the national health council, taking into account the possibility of scientific dissemination of the results obtained. The selection method adopted will be non-probability sampling, convenience sampling. The participants of the study will be recruited in the reference hospital for oncologic care in Florianópolis- State of Santa Catarina/Brazil, the Oncology Research Center, through a retrospective and active search in the medical records, in order to recover clinical data and contact of the participants with up to 24 months after the curative surgical intervention. There will also be recruitment through dissemination of the study via media and social networks, folders and messages, so that women voluntarily apply for the research. The sample will consist of women diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoing surgical treatment, with up to 24 months postoperatively, present functional disability and impaired quality of life, able to understand and access mobile applications or live with someone who helps them, have access to the internet and telephone for contact."

Patients waiting for, or in follow-up from, outpatient psychological therapy will complete first a two-week period of daily symptom monitoring, followed by two different two-week cognitive training interventions. Data collected will be used to assess feasibility of a future formal case series using Bayesian sequential analyses to determine switching of interventions, and inform the analysis parameters for such a future study."

The intervention is a series of training sessions in which participants listen to training scenarios consisting of descriptions of everyday situations, structured so that they start ambiguously but always end positively. Participants are instructed to imagine themselves in the situations described as the scenarios unfold. The training aims to train a bias to automatically imagine positive resolutions for ambiguous situations encountered in daily life.\n\nParticipants will complete one introductory session of the training with the researcher present (in the outpatient center, or via videoconferencing software), then 8 sessions over two weeks completed from home via the study website.",
